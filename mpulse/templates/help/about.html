<h3>The M-Pulse Project</h3>
        <p>
        The goal of the M-PULSE project is to democratize access to personal biosensors through the
        use of community-accessible bio-sensing kiosks. The M-PULSE kiosks will be placed in public
        spaces such as subway stations and neighborhood parks with two primary aims. The first aim is
        to provide individuals access to biosensors providing information on heart rate, blood oxygen
        levels, blood pressure, body fat percentage, weight, stress levels, respiration rate and variability,
        glucose levels, and other vital health indicators. This information is useful in both the monitoring
        of chronic health conditions and in the early detection of possible health problems. While
        personal health-monitoring sensors such as FitBit and Nike Pulse band have penetrated the
        athlete market, these products are currently sold at a price point higher than what the general
        public is willing to pay to monitor health trends outside of the doctor's office. By making these
        sensors free and publicly available, the Little Devices group hopes to empower individuals to
        take their health into their own hands. The second aim of the M-PULSE kiosks is the collection
        of general public health information from various communities in order to better understand the
        relationship between demographics, health interests, and health outcomes. Our team wants to
        understand the "health pulse" of different transportation routes and neighborhoods in order to
        inform public health policies.

    The Little Devices group at MIT develops empowerment technologies for health.
    We believe that innovation and design happens at the frontline of healthcare where providers and patients can invent everyday technologies to improve outcomes.
    To that end we work on developing DIY medical devices to bring the power of technology and innovation to the hands on the ground.
