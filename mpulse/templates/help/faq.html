            The data from M-Pulse kiosks is not meant as a replacement for regularly scheduled doctor's visits. Rather, it is meant to help you stay healthy by providing convenient
            and free health information that is accessible whenever you need it. M-Pulse kiosk data should be used in conjunction with professional health services, not as a replacement.
