Raspi
		
	set up real-time-clock with ala mode (need a battery)
	
	kiosk mode
	
	make sure things that get turned on on page entry get turned off on page leave (make exit method called from jquery)
		ECG (walkthrough2)
		EL light (walkthrough1)
	
	ECG
		toggle var for ecg reading/not reading so /readings/ecg doesn't hang
		Time the # of updates with how often we update so it doesn't get so far behind
			also periodically clear / reset the whole thing
			(could reduce samples to every other or put a delay in the alamode code)
			
		Need to display longer periods of time (3 seconds)
			
		Investigate analog-reading alternatives to having the raspi sample so quickly
